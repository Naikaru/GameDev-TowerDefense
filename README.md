# Tower Defense Mini-Project 

Based on [Unity 6 par la pratique : Le cours ultime TOUT en 1 !](https://www.udemy.com/course/formation-unity-par-la-pratique-le-cours-ultime-tout-en-1-unity/) training course presented by [Anthony Cardinale](https://www.anthony-cardinale.fr/) and further extended.

Very classic tower defense game, to work on wave management, event systems and overall a better OOP architecture.

* **Simple UI systems** to build, upgrade, and sell the turrets;
* A **gold manager** that interacts with the player actions and the mob deaths;
* **Basic AI path finding** system for the mob to reach the Tower;
* **Waves system**, adjustable mob spawning characteristics;
* Two types of turrets : **projectiles** for burst damage and **flamethrower** for dps damages;
* Strong emphasis on **design patterns** implementation (Factories, Builder, Observers, Object Pooling, ...);
* Develop our own *level builder* to design and create our levels faster !
